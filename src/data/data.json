I found that prototyping in VR was difficult because of the lack of translation from 2d to 3d. To remedy this, I used VR Framer.js plugin to develop live clickable prototypes in 360 that I could hand off to my developer. These prototypes helped me understand scene transitions, menu location, motion interaction in VR that would become important in the final app itself. "

We added icons for all the hidden objects and added sound to each environment to increase the immersive nature of the app."

Massachusetts has one of the highest rates of overdose deaths in the country, with nearly 2,000 people dying from overdoses in 2016 alone. The epidemic can easily be observed at what is commonly called Boston’s “Methadone Mile” — what we prefer to call “Recovery Road.” This refuge and haven for those with substance use disorder, at the edge of Boston’s South End, Roxbury, and Dorchester neighborhoods, is a walking distance from Northeastern University. Because of this we decided to create a project to help family, friends, and the public understand the struggle of those suffering through addiction."

I eventually met Paul who became the center storyline of the prototype and helped me understand what real addiction looked and felt like. "
