I had the opportunity to have a positive impact on this problem while working for MIT's Sloan School of Management on an online platform called Shift Tools. The platform is made up of an evolving community of corporate sustainability practitioners, sustainability-oriented entrepreneurs, and impact investors working together to curate and review tools to help large corporations change their behavior. I was brought on at the beginning of the project to help design the product strategy, UX/UI, and branding. This would later lead to a follow-up project to redesign the United Nations Global Compact Sustainability Library.",

After five months of studying, I created an online training curriculum with a colleague Tyler Wakefield to give Sunrisers a greater understanding of the systematic nature of the climate crisis and a greater in-depth look at concepts such as the Green New Deal, systems thinking, and modern economic theory. We hope to challenge Sunrisers to take a more critical, thoughtful, and effective approach to their organizing, one that we hope better aligns beliefs, actions, and habits with those necessary to create the truly transformative and just change for an equitable and safe future."

We are hoping to pressure these companies to take direct action in pushing their technology and investment out of the fossil fuel industry all while creating a public national narrative that progressive companies are instituting values bases change. My effort on this team directly led to large participation in the September 20th strike, presentations at Google and other tech companies, a hundred thousand dollars in donation and an educational futurist workshop and panel on the alignment of tech, activism, and policy to address the climate crisis."

After talking with the founder, I also learned that the business was reliant on some huge partnerships with their longtime clients. Because of this, I didn't want to alter the brand too drastically and confuse returning users to the system. I focused on simplifying and elevating their brand by standardizing and refreshing while adding a few new concepts that spoke to the core of the company."
